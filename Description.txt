Visma Solutions - programming task

I understanded that the task was to make a class which gets uri as a parameter.
This uri needs to be sliced up to "smaller" parts to schema, path and parameters.
Class needs to validate these parts, only acceptable schema is "visma-identity" 
and acceptable paths are "login", "confirm" or "sign". These different paths have
different parameters: login (source), confirm (source and payment number) and 
sign (source and documentid). Also these parameters has to be validated.
Class returns path and parameters as key value pairs.

Task description didn't have any restrictions of using libraries, so I used 
Java.net.URI -class to parse input uri. Description didn't take stand which data 
structures you should you use, so I used Hashmap to store key value
pairs and Arraylist to return path and parameters. Not sure if that was mented.
Also I was little uncertain about client implementation. My solution was to make another
simple class which calls another class and gives uri- requests as parameter.

My implementation doesn't do much if validate fails, so this could be improved. However 
task description didn't descripbe what this class should do if one of uri parts 
is wrong. In addition I am wondering if parameter types should be also validated, so
this could possibly be improved too. Also my validation has many if-else statements, 
this could maybe be improved but at this time this was simplest solution I came up with.
